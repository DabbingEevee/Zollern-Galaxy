===== CHANGELOG =====
Zollern Galaxy v2.0.24
=====================

* Added Exodus Space Station.
* Added new star system Pantheon, with new planet Vortex; a super-storm planet.
    - To get to it, Players must use the Eden Star Gate while on Exodus.
* Added Storm Crystals, only harvestable while storming (which for Vortex is always).
* Added the Storm Protection potion effect.
* Added the Storm Amulet, crafted with Virinium Ingots and Storm Crystals.
    - Protects the Player from harsh winds by giving them the Storm Protection potion effect.
* Added strong winds to Vortex that can push the Player around, making traversing the terrain difficult.
    - Being in shelter prevents the Player from being pushed.
        -- Uses the same logic that Zombies use for burning in the sun.
    - 25% chance by default; controllable in config.
    - Can be protected against by having a Storm Amulet.

    - Current mutates: Volatile, Seeker, Overlord, Ghoul
    - Inspired by Dying Light.

    - Does not affect special or planet-specific Villagers.
