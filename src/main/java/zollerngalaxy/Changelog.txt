===== CHANGELOG =====
Zollern Galaxy v2.0.16
=====================

* Created planet Caligro and added its ores and mobs.
    - Planet is heavily inspired by the Netflix web series, Stranger Things.
    - This dimension was first featured in Zollern Extras before being ported over as a planet.
    - Extremely dangerous planet with loads of resources and Dark Agent mobs.
    - This is the first planet to not feature any Villages.
* Increased hitbox of Moolus mob.
* Added the Krull mob.
    - Infects Players within a 3 to 5 block radius, who can then infect other Players.
        - Those Players can then infect others within that same radius, etc.
        - The infection will rapidly kill the Player.
    - Inspired by the Demogorgon.
    - Model made by DabbingEevee.
* Added the poisonous Spiderling mob.
    - Hatches from egg sacs that are deposted in nests on planet Caligro.
    - Will occasionally place cobwebs where it walks and can lay more eggs.
        - Sometimes laying more eggs will actually kill the spider.
        - When the egg proceeds closer to hatching, a heartbeat sound will play.
* Added the Shadow Skeleton mob.
    - Similar to a regular Skeleton, but a Dark Agent version that's been corrupted.
    - Drops Shadow Bones.
    - Has more health, speed and attack power than a regular Skeleton and is bigger.
* Added the Shade mob.
    - A Dark Agent version of the Zombie.
* Added the Corruption Layer to cave systems in Caligro.
    - Will damage the Player without proper protection.
    - Special ores can be found here.
    - Spawns at layers 25 and below.
* Added the Shadow Boss mob.
    - Zollern Galaxy's first "boss" mob since the 1.7.10 version.
    - Once attacked, it has a chance to heal damage from anywhere between 10 - 20 hearts.
    - When the beast reaches half of its health, it will start spawning Scorpions.
        - Its attack damage will also increase.
* Removed "hurt2" from Wasp sound events as it doesn't exist.
* Spiderling nests spawn throughout Caligro - be wary.
