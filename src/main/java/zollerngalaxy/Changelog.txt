===== CHANGELOG =====
Zollern Galaxy v2.0.2
=====================

* Updated to latest Forge and Galacticraft versions.
* Fixed glitch with Planet Progression not picking up Zollern Galaxy planets/moons.
    * Removed my "workaround" that was temporary. Many thanks to MJRLegends for his help!
* Added a search bar to the Creative Tabs.
* Fixed Kriffon Crystal recipe to use Tier 2 Heavy Duty Plating instead of Virinium.
* Changed EnumBlockVariant to EnumBlockTier (10 Tiers but only 4 matter right now).
* Kriffon ores now have a chance to blow up when harvested/destroyed by a Player if they are in Survival Mode.
* Purgot ores now have a chance to give varying Potion Effects when harvested/destroyed by a Player if they are in Survival Mode.
* Mod set to load after Planet Progression.
* Renamed Star Gate "Tiers" to "Protocols" to avoid confusion.
* Star Gates are now integrated with Planet Progression.
    * If the Planet or Moon that the Gate takes the Player to is not yet researched, they will be prevented from going there.
    * In the future this will be toggleable in the config.
