    - Planet is heavily inspired by the Netflix web series, Stranger Things.

    - This is the first planet to not feature any Villages or Space Stations (yet).
* Increased hitbox of Moolus mob.
* Added the Krull mob.
    - Infects Players within a 3 to 5 block radius, who can then infect other Players.
        - Those Players can then infect others within that same radius, etc.
        - The infection will rapidly kill the Player.
    - Inspired by the Demogorgon.
    - Model made by DabbingEevee.

    - Hatches from egg sacs that are deposted in nests on planet Caligro.
    - Will occasionally place cobwebs where it walks and can lay more eggs.
        - Sometimes laying more eggs will actually kill the spider.
        - When the egg proceeds closer to hatching, a heartbeat sound will play.
* Added the Shadow Skeleton mob.

        - Its attack damage will also increase.
    - Generates a treasure chest when defeated.
