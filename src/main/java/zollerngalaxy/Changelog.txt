=====================

* Added Korean and Chinese language files.
    - Korean done by mindy15963.

* Further cut down spawn rate of Frost Giants.
* Updated to latest 1.12.2 Forge and Galacticraft versions.
* Fixed temperature bug on my planets due to change in Galacticraft thermal level modifier functionality.
    - Galactic HUD now uses a separate system to display aesthetic temperatures.
* Modified the SkyProvider for planet Zollus.
    - Planets no longer display in the sky. This is, surprisingly, what was causing the lag.

    - Decreased spawn rate of craters and Magma Blocks.
    - Magma Blocks no longer spawn on the surface.
