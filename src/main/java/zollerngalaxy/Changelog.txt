Zollern Galaxy v2.0.15
=====================

* Increased score value and step height of Gray Aliens.
* Updated Chinese translations by EndsM.

* Added the Galaxy Knight.
    - Spawns when a Gray Alien is attacked and immediately targets the Player.

* Added potion effects.
* Added a lot more items and blocks with new metals.
* Added Caligro blocks and items.

* Massively lowered spawn rate of ores in Xathius.
* Fixed crash when creating an Altum space station (I'm sure this time).
