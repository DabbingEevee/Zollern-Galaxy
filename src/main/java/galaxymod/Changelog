== Zollern Galaxy v1.4.4 - ChunkProvider Hotfix ==

    * This is in an attempt to stop the type-cast crashes with Thaumcraft (and potentially other mods as well).

== Zollern Galaxy v1.4.3 ==

* Survival effects no longer affect blueprints or Players when in Creative Mode.
* Changed the color of the Zollus Dirt block.
* Added a new block to Eden called Golden Grass.
    * Just like regular grass, but golden!
* Added a new biome to Eden called Golden Meadow.
    * Golden Grass on top and Eden's Soil on the bottom.
* "Outposts" now generate throughout Eden, anywhere on the planet.
    * Random shelters that spawn as a convenience for the Player.
    * Will always have a Healing Station and a Blueprint Repair Station.
        * Healing Stations heal the Player's health fully.
        * Blueprint Repair stations repair the Blueprint that the Player is holding when they right-click the block.
* Updated Kriffon's ChunkProvider code to match Eden and Zollus.

== Zollern Galaxy v1.4.2 - Xathius Hotfix ==

* Fixed Abstract Plains having biome ID of 0.
    * I called the wrong variable name in the config, apparently.
* Fixed Xathius lag issues.
    * Forgot this one apparently, should be good now though.

== Zollern Galaxy v1.4.1 - Planet Lag Hotfix ==

* Fixed lag issues on Zollus, Kriffon and Purgot.
    * This was accomplished by removing the "CloudRenderer" methods from their respective WorldProvider classes.
* Modified ChunkProviderZollus.java's mechanics to mimic Eden's.
* Water on Purgot has been replaced with Purgot Dirt.
    * The planet is intended to be too cool for water to stay in liquid form.
* Changed texture of Magrock from black to bright orange.
    * This fits much better with the colors of the rest of Eden.
        * Also makes it harder to see the lava lakes, which is a good survival mechanic in itself.
* Water in the Magma Lands biome on planet Eden has now been changed to Magrock.

== Zollern Galaxy v1.4 - Galatic Revamp ==

* FINALLY FIXED THE LAG ISSUE!!!! Turns out it was how I was registering my SkyRenderer classes!!!!
    * If you still experience the extreme lag/memory leakage, then please, please contact me!
* Some mechanical fixes to hopefully reduce the lag a little bit.
* Changed BiomeGenEdenBase back to BiomeGenBase in WorldChunkManagerEden.java.
* Changed ChunkProviderEden.java's mechanics to something faster and a bit more streamlined.

== Zollern Galaxy v1.3.1 - Baby Steps ==

* Removed server pre-init phase.
* Changed BiomeGenBase to BiomeGenEdenBase in WorldChunkManagerEden.java.
* Changed BiomeGenBase code in all base biome gens to have 32 sea level and start chunks from 255.
* Changed biome decorator ore generation mechanics.

== Zollern Galaxy v1.3 - Acknowledging Issues ==

[NOTE: This release is meant to FIX ISSUES while adding very limited new things.]

* Renamed mod from Project Nova to Zollern Galaxy.
* Applied an instanceof check to (hopefully) prevent biomes being cast as BiomeGenEdenBase, which caused crashes.
    * Also applied this to other BiomeSpace gens as well.
* Did some minor tweaking on the Crawler boss.
    * It will actually fight back now.
* Removed "Caverns" from new planet world gen.
    * Way too much strain on the JVM to generate this so often.
    * Caves still generate, but the huge, round rooms do not.
* Implemented new survival mechanics for the planets.
    * Planets can now cause two new types of damage:
        * Radioactive and Toxic
        * Each Planet has its own levels for each.
            * If the levels are above (or below) a certain value, the Player will be damaged.
                * This can be prevented by having the respective blueprint for protection in your inventory.
                    * The blueprints also take damage over time and must be recharged. 
                        * (Recharging not yet operational as of right now)
* Changed random Y coordinate's max spawn from 256 to 128.
    * This should lower memory usage by a crap-ton.
* Added more Planet bioclasses.
    * Each one is described in the code now.
* Changed how Planet gasses are registered.
* Reduced number of ores generated per chunk on all planets.
* Added Compressed Emerald, Compressed Diamond and Compressed Gold items.
    * Used in constructing Survival Blueprints.
* Protection blueprints are now craftable.
* Slightly tweaked planet temperature algorithm.
* Added the Oasis planet in the Praedyth star system.
    * This planet is based on a planet I encountered once in No Man's Sky that I will never see again.
* Set gasses to null after they're retrieved.
* Added Oasis Crystal.
    * Takes user to planet Oasis in the Praedyth system.
        * Currently unfinished planet, will be modified and improved in the next major update.
    * Craftable.
* Added a special "Healing Station" block that heals the Player when right-clicked.
    * Not obtainable in Survival yet.
* Removed chunk changing events from NovaEvents.java.

-- FIXES --
* Fixed there being too many stars in the sky.
* Fixed (?) crash relating to BiomeGenEdenBase.
    * Won't know for sure until released for production.
        * Will be released as a beta version for this reason.
* Fixed (hopefully) extreme memory leak by removing and lowering some stuff.
